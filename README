NAME
    App::bmkpasswd - bcrypt-enabled mkpasswd

SYNOPSIS
      bmkpasswd --help
  
      bmkpasswd
      bmkpasswd --workcost='06'
  
      ## glibc-2.7+ only (that I am aware of):
      bmkpasswd --method='sha512'

DESCRIPTION
    App::bmkpasswd is a simple bcrypt-enabled mkpasswd.

    See `bmkpasswd --help' for usage information.

    Uses Crypt::Eksblowfish::Bcrypt for bcrypted passwords.

    SHA-256 and SHA-512 are supported if available. You'll need either
    Crypt::Passwd::XS or a system crypt() that can handle SHA (such as
    glibc-2.7 and newer).

    MD5 uses the system's `crypt()' (support for it is fairly universal).

    Salts are randomly generated.

EXPORTED
    You can use the exported mkpasswd and passwdcmp functions in other Perl
    modules/applications:

      use App::bmkpasswd;
      ## Generate a bcrypted passwd with work-cost 08:
      $bcrypted = mkpasswd($passwd);
      ## Generate a bcrypted passwd with other work-cost:
      $bcrypted = mkpasswd($passwd, 'bcrypt', '06');
      ## SHA:
      $crypted = mkpasswd($passwd, 'sha256');
      $crypted = mkpasswd($passwd, 'sha512');

      ## Compare a password against a hash:
      $pwd_matched++ if passwdcmp($passwd, $hash);

BUGS
    There is currently no easy way to pass your own salt; frankly, this
    thing is aimed at some projects of mine where that issue is unlikely to
    come up and randomized is appropriate. If that's a problem, patches
    welcome? ;-)
